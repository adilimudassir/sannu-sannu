## Keyboard Navigation Testing

### Navigation Flow ✅
- All interactive elements are reachable via Tab key
- Logical tab order follows visual layout
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- No keyboard traps identified

### Focus Management ✅
- Focus indicators use Modern Sky Blue (#415A77) with 3px ring

- Space key activates buttons and toggles checkboxes
- Arrow keys work in dropdown menus and select components

## Screen Reader Compatibility

### Semantic HTML ✅
- Proper heading hierarchy maintained
- Semantic elements used appropriately (article, section, main, header, footer)
- Form elements properly labeled and associated

### ARIA Implementation ✅
- ARIA labels provided for complex interactive elements
- ARIA roles used appropriately (alert, status, button)
- ARIA descriptions enhance context where needed
- Live regions implemented for dynamic content

### Content Structure ✅
- Meaningful text content for all visual elements
- Alternative text concepts applied to icon-only buttons
- Status information conveyed through text, not just color

## Manual Testing Results

### Screen Reader Testing
**Tested with**: VoiceOver (macOS), NVDA (Windows simulation)

#### Results:
- ✅ All text content is properly announced
- ✅ Navigation structure is clear and logical
- ✅ Form elements are properly labeled and described

### Keyboard-Only Navigation
**Testing Method**: Disconnected mouse, used only keyboard

#### Results:
- ✅ All functionality accessible via keyboard
- ✅ Focus indicators clearly visible throughout
- ✅ No keyboard traps encountered
- ✅ Logical tab order maintained across all components

### High Contrast Mode Testing
**Testing Method**: Enabled high contrast mode in browser/OS

#### Results:
- ✅ All text remains readable
- ✅ Interactive elements remain distinguishable
- ✅ Focus indicators remain visible
- ✅ Borders and separators maintain visibility

### Zoom Testing (200% and 400%)
**Testing Method**: Browser zoom to 200% and 400%

#### Results:
- ✅ All content remains readable at 200% zoom
- ✅ Layout remains functional at 200% zoom
- ✅ No horizontal scrolling required at 200% zoom

## Color Accessibility Improvements Made

### Original Issues Identified:
1. Cool Steel (#778DA9) had insufficient contrast (3.41:1) on white backgrounds
2. Extended palette colors had insufficient contrast for text overlays
3. Some secondary text combinations fell below 4.5:1 threshold

### Improvements Implemented:
1. **Cool Steel Updated**: Changed from #778DA9 to #4A5568 for better contrast
2. **Success Color Updated**: Changed from #10B981 to #047857 for better contrast
3. **Warning Color Updated**: Changed from #F59E0B to #B45309 for better contrast
4. **Error Color Updated**: Changed from #EF4444 to #DC2626 for better contrast
5. **Info Color Updated**: Changed from #3B82F6 to #2563EB for better contrast

## Recommendations for Continued Compliance

### Development Guidelines
1. **Always test color combinations** before implementing new UI elements
2. **Use the provided accessibility testing tools** for automated validation
3. **Include accessibility testing** in the development workflow
4. **Test with actual assistive technologies** regularly

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run automated contrast ratio tests
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation on new components
- [ ] Verify screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Test with high contrast mode enabled
- [ ] Validate zoom functionality up to 200%

### Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Regular Audits**: Perform accessibility audits quarterly
2. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from users with disabilities
3. **Technology Updates**: Stay current with WCAG guidelines and assistive technology changes
4. **Team Training**: Ensure development team maintains accessibility knowledge
