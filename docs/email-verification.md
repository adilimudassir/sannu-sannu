# Email Verification Enhancement

## Overview

The email verification system has been enhanced to work seamlessly with the Authentication architecture, providing a secure and user-friendly experience for email verification across all user roles.

## Features

### 1. Global Email Verification
- Email verification works at the global level, not requiring tenant context
- All users must verify their email before accessing protected features
- Verification status is maintained globally across all tenant contexts

### 2. Role-Based Redirects
After successful email verification, users are redirected based on their role:
- **System Admins**: Redirected to the system admin dashboard
- **Tenant Admins**: Redirected to tenant selection page
- **Contributors**: Redirected to the global contributor dashboard

### 3. Enhanced UI Components
- Responsive email verification page using the AuthCard layout
- Clear user feedback for verification status
- Helpful instructions and tips for users
- Countdown timer for throttled requests
- Accessibility-compliant design

### 4. Security Features
- **Link Expiration**: Verification links expire after 60 minutes
- **Request Throttling**: Users can only request new verification emails once per minute
- **Audit Logging**: All verification events are logged for security monitoring
- **Signed URLs**: Verification links use Laravel's signed URL mechanism

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- Clear status messages for different verification states
- Option to resend verification emails
- Logout option for users who want to use a different account
- Contact support information for users having trouble

## Implementation Details

### Controllers
- `EmailVerificationPromptController`: Shows the verification page
- `EmailVerificationNotificationController`: Handles resending verification emails
- `VerifyEmailController`: Processes verification link clicks

### Middleware
- `EnsureEmailIsVerified`: Protects routes that require verified email
- Applied to all protected routes except logout and verification routes

### Routes
Email verification routes are global (not tenant-specific):
- `GET /verify-email` - Show verification page
- `GET /verify-email/{id}/{hash}` - Process verification link
- `POST /email/verification-notification` - Resend verification email

### User Model
- Implements `MustVerifyEmail` interface
- Uses Laravel's built-in email verification functionality

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:
- Unit tests for all controllers
- Integration tests for complete verification flows
- Frontend component tests
- Security and edge case testing

## Usage

### For New Users
1. Register an account
2. Automatically redirected to email verification page
3. Check email for verification link
4. Click link to verify email
5. Redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role

### For Existing Unverified Users
1. Attempt to access protected feature
2. Redirected to email verification page
3. Request new verification email if needed
4. Complete verification process

## Security Considerations

- All verification events are logged for audit purposes
- Rate limiting prevents spam and abuse
- Signed URLs ensure link integrity
- Proper error handling prevents information disclosure
- CSRF protection on all forms

## Accessibility

The email verification interface follows WCAG guidelines:
- Proper heading structure
- Clear form labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast design elements
