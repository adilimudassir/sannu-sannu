# Role-Based Access Control System Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the Sannu-Sannu multi-tenant platform. The system provides comprehensive authorization capabilities with three distinct user roles and proper tenant isolation.

## Implemented Components

### 1. User Roles (Enum)
- **Location**: `app/Enums/Role.php`
- **Roles**:
  - `SYSTEM_ADMIN`: Platform-wide access, can manage all tenants and system settings
  - `TENANT_ADMIN`: Full access to tenant features and user management within their tenant
  - `PROJECT_MANAGER`: Can manage projects and contributions within their tenant
  - `CONTRIBUTOR`: Basic user with contribution and profile access within their tenant

### 2. RoleMiddleware
- **Location**: `app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php`
- **Purpose**: Enforces role-based access control at the route level
- **Features**:
  - Supports multiple role requirements (OR logic)
  - Proper authentication checking
  - Tenant-aware login redirects
  - Clear error messages for insufficient permissions

### 3. Authorization Policies
Comprehensive policy system for resource-level authorization:

#### UserPolicy (`app/Policies/UserPolicy.php`)
- Controls access to user management features
- Tenant admins can manage all users in their tenant
- Users can manage their own profiles
- Prevents self-deletion and self-role-change

#### TenantPolicy (`app/Policies/TenantPolicy.php`)
- Controls tenant-level operations
- System admins can manage all tenants
- Tenant admins can modify their own tenant settings
- Proper tenant isolation enforcement

#### SystemAdminPolicy (`app/Policies/SystemAdminPolicy.php`)
- Controls platform-wide operations
- Only system admins can access platform features
- Manages system settings, analytics, and maintenance
- Controls tenant creation and suspension

#### ProjectPolicy (`app/Policies/ProjectPolicy.php`)
- Already existed, enhanced with role-based logic
- Tenant admins and project managers can create/update projects
- Only tenant admins can delete projects

#### ContributionPolicy (`app/Policies/ContributionPolicy.php`)
- Users can manage their own contributions
- Admins/managers can manage any contributions in their tenant
- Approval permissions for managers and admins

#### ProjectInvitationPolicy (`app/Policies/ProjectInvitationPolicy.php`)
- Controls project invitation management
- Only managers and admins can send invitations
- Users can accept/decline their own invitations

### 4. User Model Enhancements
- **Location**: `app/Models/User.php`
- **Role Methods**:
  - `hasRole(Role $role)`: Check specific role
  - `hasAnyRole(array $roles)`: Check multiple roles
  - `isSystemAdmin()`, `isTenantAdmin()`, `isProjectManager()`, `isContributor()`: Convenience methods
  - `canManageProjects()`, `canManageTenant()`, `canManagePlatform()`: Permission checking methods
  - `isAdmin()`: Check if user has any admin privileges
- **Query Scopes**:
  - `scopeWithRole()`: Filter by role
  - `scopeActive()`: Filter active users
  - `scopeForCurrentTenant()`: Tenant isolation

### 5. Registration Logic
- **Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`
- **Logic**: First user in a tenant becomes `TENANT_ADMIN`, subsequent users become `CONTRIBUTOR`
- **System Admin Creation**: System admins are created manually or through seeding
- **Tenant Association**: Automatic tenant assignment during registration (not applicable to system admins)

### 6. Service Provider Registration
- **AuthServiceProvider**: `app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php`
- **Registration**: Added to `bootstrap/providers.php`
- **Policy Mapping**: All models mapped to their respective policies

### 7. Middleware Registration
- **Location**: `bootstrap/app.php`
- **Alias**: `role` middleware alias for easy route usage

## Usage Examples

### Route Protection
```php
// Require system admin role
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:system_admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/system/tenants', [SystemTenantController::class, 'index']);
    Route::get('/system/analytics', [SystemAnalyticsController::class, 'index']);
});

// Require tenant admin role
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:tenant_admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin/users', [UserController::class, 'index']);
});

// Require either system admin, tenant admin, or project manager
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:system_admin,tenant_admin,project_manager'])->group(function () {
    Route::post('/projects', [ProjectController::class, 'store']);
});
```

### Policy Usage in Controllers
```php
public function update(User $user, Request $request)
{
    $this->authorize('update', $user);
    // Update logic here
}
```

### Role Checking in Code
```php
if ($user->isSystemAdmin()) {
    // System admin-specific logic
}

if ($user->isTenantAdmin()) {
    // Tenant admin-specific logic
}

if ($user->canManageProjects()) {
    // Project management logic
}

if ($user->canManagePlatform()) {
    // Platform management logic
}
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - `RoleMiddlewareTest`: Tests middleware functionality
  - `UserPolicyTest`: Tests user policy authorization logic
  - `SystemAdminPolicyTest`: Tests system admin policy authorization logic
- **Feature Tests**:
  - `RoleBasedAccessControlTest`: End-to-end role-based access testing

### Test Results
- All tests passing with expanded coverage
- Comprehensive assertions covering various scenarios
- Full coverage of 4-role hierarchy and system admin functionality

## Security Features

### Tenant Isolation
- All policies enforce tenant-level data isolation
- Users cannot access data from other tenants
- Cross-tenant operations are prevented

### Permission Hierarchy
- System admins have the highest privileges across the entire platform
- Tenant admins have the highest privileges within their tenant
- Project managers have project-specific privileges within their tenant
- Contributors have basic access rights within their tenant
- No user can escalate their own privileges
- Only system admins can assign system admin roles

### Audit Trail Ready
- All policy methods are designed to support audit logging
- Role changes and permission checks can be logged
- User actions are traceable through the authorization system

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies all requirements from the specification plus system admin functionality:

- **4.1**: ✅ Four user roles implemented (system_admin, tenant_admin, project_manager, contributor)
- **4.3**: ✅ Role-based permission checking implemented with hierarchy
- **4.4**: ✅ Tenant admin has full access to tenant features
- **4.5**: ✅ Project manager has project management access
- **4.6**: ✅ Contributor has basic access rights
- **NEW**: ✅ System admin has platform-wide access and tenant management

## Next Steps

The role-based access control system is now fully implemented and ready for use. To integrate it into the application:

1. Apply the `role` middleware to protected routes
2. Use `$this->authorize()` in controllers for policy enforcement
3. Implement role-based UI rendering using the user role methods
4. Add audit logging for security events
5. Consider implementing role-based notifications and permissions

The system provides a solid foundation for secure, multi-tenant, role-based access control that can be extended as the application grows.
