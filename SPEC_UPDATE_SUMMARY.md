# Authentication Specification Update Summary

## Overview

The authentication specification has been **completely updated** to reflect the new Global Authentication Architecture implemented in the Sannu-Sannu platform. The changes represent a fundamental shift from tenant-scoped authentication to a global authentication system with multi-tenant role management.

## ðŸš¨ **MAJOR SPECIFICATION CHANGES** ðŸš¨

### **Previous Specification**
- Users belonged to specific tenants
- Authentication was tenant-scoped
- Users could only access their tenant's data
- Single role per user within their tenant

### **Updated Specification**
- Users authenticate globally across the platform
- Multi-tenant role assignments through pivot table
- Cross-tenant project access for contributors
- Role-based redirects after authentication
- Tenant selection interface for admin users

- Updated permission checking for multi-level roles

**Requirement 5: Multi-Tenant Integration** â†’ **Tenant Selection and Context Management**

- Updated session management for tenant context

**NEW Requirement 6: Cross-Tenant Project Access**

### 2. **`.kiro/specs/authentication-authorization/design.md`** âœ… UPDATED

#### **Major Design Changes:**

**Architecture Diagrams**
- Updated high-level architecture to show global vs tenant routes
- Replaced tenant-scoped authentication flow with global authentication flow
- Added role-based redirect logic in sequence diagrams

**Data Models**
- **User Model**: Removed `tenant_id`, added global role system
- **UserTenantRole Model**: New pivot model for multi-tenant roles
- **Tenant Model**: Updated relationships for many-to-many user associations

**Route Structure**
- Added global authentication routes (`/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard`)
- Added tenant selection routes (`/select-tenant`)
- Added system admin routes (`/admin/*`)
- Maintained tenant-specific routes for operational context

**Component Architecture**
- Added TenantSelectionController
- Added GlobalDashboardController  
- Added SystemDashboardController
- Updated existing controllers for global authentication

## Key Specification Updates

### **Authentication Flow Changes**

#### **Before (Tenant-Scoped)**
```
User â†’ /{tenant}/login â†’ Tenant Dashboard
```

#### **After (Global Authentication)**
```
Contributors: User â†’ /login â†’ Global Dashboard
Admins: User â†’ /login â†’ Tenant Selection â†’ /{tenant}/dashboard
System Admins: User â†’ /login â†’ System Dashboard
```

### **Role System Changes**

#### **Before**
- Single role per user within tenant
- Roles: tenant_admin, project_manager, contributor

#### **After**
- Global roles: system_admin, contributor
- Tenant roles: tenant_admin, project_manager
- Multi-tenant role assignments via UserTenantRole model

### **Access Pattern Changes**

#### **Before**
- Users scoped to single tenant
- No cross-tenant visibility
- Tenant context required for all operations

#### **After**
- Contributors have global project access
- Admin users can manage multiple tenants
- System admins have platform-wide access
- Tenant context optional for many operations

## Database Schema Changes Reflected

### **New Tables in Specification**
```sql
user_tenant_roles (
    id, user_id, tenant_id, role, is_active, timestamps
    UNIQUE(user_id, tenant_id)
)
```

### **Modified Tables in Specification**
```sql
users (
    -- Removed: tenant_id
    -- Updated: role enum to include system_admin
    -- Updated: email unique globally (not per tenant)
)
```
