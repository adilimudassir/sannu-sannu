## Technical Notes

### Service Layer Architecture

- All business logic should be implemented in service classes
- Controllers should be thin and delegate to services
- Controllers should handle authorization using policies and middleware
- Form requests should handle all input validation
- Services should focus on business logic and data persistence
- Include proper error handling and logging throughout

### Component Architecture

- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow React best practices for state management
- Include proper error boundaries and loading states

### Database Considerations

- Use database transactions for multi-table operations
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Include soft deletes where appropriate
- Add database-level constraints for data integrity

### File Management

- Store uploaded images in Laravel Storage
- Implement proper file validation and security
- Include automatic cleanup of orphaned files
- Add image optimization and resizing

### Authorization Integration

- Leverage existing role-based access control system
- Use Laravel policies for fine-grained permissions
- Include proper middleware for route protection
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### Performance Optimization

- Implement proper pagination for large datasets
- Use eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Include database query optimization

This implementation plan ensures that all requirements are addressed through incremental development, with each task building upon previous work while maintaining code quality and architectural consistency.
