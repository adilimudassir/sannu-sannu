# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Project Management System is a core feature of the Sannu-Sannu platform that enables tenant administrators to create, manage, and control contribution-based projects. This system provides comprehensive project lifecycle management, product management within projects, and public project discovery capabilities. The system operates within the existing global authentication architecture where users can participate in projects across multiple tenants.
