# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a modern minimalist blue theme system for the React/Laravel application based on the provided blue palette guidelines. The theme will replace the current neutral color scheme with a cohesive blue palette that maintains accessibility standards while providing a modern, professional appearance across all UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to use a consistent modern blue color scheme, so that the interface feels cohesive and professionally branded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL apply the Deep Navy (#0D1B2A) as the primary background color for headers and hero sections
2. WHEN displaying navigation elements THEN the system SHALL use Royal Blue (#1B263B) for navigation bars and section backgrounds
3. WHEN rendering interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use Modern Sky Blue (#415A77) for buttons, links, and highlights
4. WHEN showing borders and secondary text THEN the system SHALL use Cool Steel Blue (#778DA9) for borders, icons, and secondary text
5. WHEN displaying page backgrounds THEN the system SHALL use Soft Ice Blue (#E0E1DD) for neutral spaces and page backgrounds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme to support both light and dark modes, so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects light mode THEN the system SHALL apply the light variant of the blue theme with appropriate contrast ratios
2. WHEN the user selects dark mode THEN the system SHALL apply the dark variant using darker blue tones while maintaining the same color hierarchy
3. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual hierarchy and component relationships
4. WHEN in either mode THEN the system SHALL ensure all text meets WCAG AA accessibility contrast requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme colors to be easily configurable through CSS variables and Tailwind classes, so that the theme can be consistently applied across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL provide CSS custom properties for all blue palette colors
2. WHEN using Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL extend the default theme with the blue palette colors
3. WHEN building UI components THEN the system SHALL map semantic color names (primary, secondary, accent) to the appropriate blue palette colors
4. WHEN updating the theme THEN the system SHALL allow changes through a centralized configuration without modifying individual components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing UI components to automatically adopt the new blue theme, so that the entire application has a consistent appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the system SHALL apply the blue theme to all existing components including buttons, cards, forms, navigation, and sidebars
2. WHEN interacting with form elements THEN the system SHALL use the blue palette for focus states, borders, and validation feedback
3. WHEN viewing data displays THEN the system SHALL use the blue palette for charts, tables, and other data visualization elements
4. WHEN using the sidebar and navigation THEN the system SHALL apply the appropriate blue tones for different hierarchy levels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme implementation to maintain the existing component functionality, so that no features are broken during the theme update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new theme is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing component behaviors and interactions
2. WHEN using interactive elements THEN the system SHALL maintain hover, focus, and active states with appropriate blue color variations
3. WHEN viewing responsive layouts THEN the system SHALL ensure the blue theme works correctly across all screen sizes
4. WHEN using accessibility features THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve accessibility compliance with the new color scheme
