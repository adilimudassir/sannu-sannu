## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) practices for all new functionality
- Implement comprehensive error handling and validation at every layer
- Use existing patterns from the codebase (Role enum, UserTenantRole relationships, etc.)
- Leverage existing infrastructure (audit logging, email notifications, etc.)
- Ensure all new features integrate seamlessly with existing authentication flows

### Code Quality Standards
- Maintain consistency with existing code style and patterns
- Use Laravel best practices for controllers, services, and models
- Follow React and TypeScript best practices for frontend components
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use existing shadcn/ui components for consistent design

### Testing Requirements
- Achieve minimum 90% code coverage for all new functionality
- Test all user workflows from start to finish
- Include edge cases and error conditions in test coverage
- Test email notifications and external integrations
- Validate security and access control thoroughly

### Performance Considerations
- Implement proper database indexing for search and filtering operations
- Use pagination for all list views to handle large datasets
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries to prevent N+1 problems
- Use background jobs for time-consuming operations

### Security Requirements
- Validate all user inputs on both frontend and backend
- Implement proper access control for all administrative functions
- Use CSRF protection for all state-changing operations
- Implement rate limiting for form submissions
- Ensure audit trails cannot be tampered with
- Follow GDPR compliance for user data handling

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the tenant registration system while maintaining high code quality, security standards, and user experience.
