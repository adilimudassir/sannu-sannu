# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive tenant registration and system admin management system for the Sannu-Sannu platform. The system enables organizations to register as tenants through an approval workflow, while providing system administrators with powerful tools to manage tenants, users, and platform operations. This feature builds upon the existing global authentication architecture to support multi-tenant organizational management with proper oversight and control mechanisms.

The system addresses the critical need for controlled tenant onboarding, comprehensive user management across tenants, and platform-wide administrative oversight while maintaining the flexibility of the global authentication model.
