# Authentication & Authorization Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the **Global Authentication System** implemented for the Sannu-Sannu multi-tenant SaaS platform. The system provides global user authentication with multi-tenant role-based access control, allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple tenant organizations based on their permissions.

## ðŸš¨ **MAJOR ARCHITECTURE CHANGE** ðŸš¨

**Previous System**: Tenant-scoped authentication where users belonged to specific tenants.
**New System**: Global authentication where users authenticate once and can access multiple tenants based on their roles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Global Authentication UI

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate globally without needing to specify a tenant, so that I can access projects and features across all organizations based on my permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the global login page (/login) THEN the system SHALL display a centered card layout with the login form
2. WHEN a user views the login form THEN it SHALL include email and password fields with proper styling and validation
3. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate globally and redirect based on their role:
   - Contributors â†’ Global dashboard showing all public projects
   - Admin users â†’ Tenant selection page
   - System admins â†’ System administration dashboard
4. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display error messages within the card layout
5. WHEN a user views the form on mobile devices THEN the card SHALL be responsive and properly sized
6. WHEN a user interacts with form fields THEN they SHALL have proper focus states and accessibility features

### Requirement 2: Global Registration System

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for a global account that allows me to participate in projects across all organizations, so that I can contribute to any public project or receive invitations from any tenant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the global registration page (/register) THEN the system SHALL display a centered card layout with registration form fields (name, email, password, password confirmation)
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new global user account with unique email across the entire platform
3. WHEN a user submits invalid registration data THEN the system SHALL display validation errors within the card layout
4. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL assign them the default "contributor" role globally
5. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN they SHALL be able to see public projects from all tenants
6. WHEN a user registers THEN they SHALL be able to receive private project invitations from any tenant

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Password Reset with Improved UI

**User Story:** As a user who has forgotten their password, I want to reset it using a modern interface, so that I can regain access to my account easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Forgot Password" THEN the system SHALL display a centered card layout with password reset request form
2. WHEN a user submits their email for password reset THEN the system SHALL use Laravel's existing password reset functionality
3. WHEN a user clicks a valid reset link THEN the system SHALL display a centered card with new password form
4. WHEN a user submits a new password THEN the system SHALL update their password using Laravel's existing reset mechanism
5. WHEN a user views password reset forms THEN they SHALL be responsive and accessible
6. WHEN password reset is completed THEN the system SHALL redirect to login with success message

### Requirement 4: Multi-Level Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control user access based on both global and tenant-specific roles, so that users can have different permissions across different organizations while maintaining platform-wide access patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL support global roles (system_admin, contributor) and tenant-specific roles (tenant_admin, project_manager)
2. WHEN a user attempts to access a protected resource THEN the system SHALL verify their appropriate role permissions (global or tenant-specific)
3. WHEN a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL display a 403 Forbidden error
4. WHEN a system_admin accesses the system THEN they SHALL have platform-wide access to all tenants and system features
5. WHEN a tenant_admin accesses the system THEN they SHALL be able to select which tenant to manage and have full access to that tenant's features
6. WHEN a project_manager accesses the system THEN they SHALL be able to select which tenant to manage and have project management access within that tenant
7. WHEN a contributor accesses the system THEN they SHALL have global access to all public projects and can receive invitations from any tenant

### Requirement 5: Tenant Selection and Context Management

**User Story:** As an admin user with roles in multiple tenants, I want to select which organization to manage after logging in, so that I can efficiently switch between different organizations I administer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to a tenant selection page showing all tenants they have roles in
2. WHEN a user selects a tenant THEN the system SHALL store the tenant context in their session and redirect to the tenant dashboard
3. WHEN a user is managing a tenant THEN they SHALL be able to switch to another tenant without re-authenticating
4. WHEN a user accesses tenant-specific routes THEN the system SHALL enforce their permissions within that tenant context
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear both authentication and tenant context
6. WHEN a user has no admin roles THEN they SHALL be redirected to the global contributor dashboard

### Requirement 6: Cross-Tenant Project Access

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want to discover and participate in public projects from all organizations on the platform, so that I can find the best opportunities regardless of which tenant created them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contributor accesses their dashboard THEN they SHALL see public projects from all tenants in a unified view
2. WHEN a contributor joins a project THEN they SHALL be able to join projects from any tenant without additional authentication
3. WHEN a contributor receives a private project invitation THEN they SHALL be able to accept invitations from any tenant
4. WHEN a contributor views their contributions THEN they SHALL see all their contributions across all tenants in one place
5. WHEN a contributor searches for projects THEN the search SHALL include projects from all tenants
6. WHEN a contributor views project details THEN they SHALL see which tenant/organization owns the project

### Requirement 7: Account Verification

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to ensure user email addresses are verified, so that we maintain data quality and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL send an email verification link
2. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL mark their email as verified
3. WHEN an unverified user attempts to access certain features THEN the system SHALL prompt them to verify their email
4. WHEN a user requests a new verification email THEN the system SHALL send a fresh verification link
5. WHEN a verification link expires THEN the system SHALL allow the user to request a new one
6. WHEN a user's email is verified THEN they SHALL have full access to platform features

3. WHEN a user changes their email THEN the system SHALL require email verification for the new address
4. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL require their current password for verification
5. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL log the changes for audit purposes
6. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL soft delete the account and anonymize personal data

### Requirement 8: Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want robust security measures in place, so that user data and the platform are protected from threats.
